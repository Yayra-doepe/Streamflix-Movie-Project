# Streamflix-Movie-Project
Welcome to the **Streamflix** movie project! This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and actionable insights to help the client convert **free users** into **paid subscribers** by leveraging data from user behavior, movie preferences, and ratings.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze user engagement and behavior to identify factors that influence subscription conversions. Using data from users, movies, and ratings, we aim to:

- Understand user preferences and viewing patterns
- Identify high-engagement users likely to convert
- Recommend strategies to drive subscription uptake

## Datasets

The project uses three main datasets provided by the client:

1. **Users Dataset** (`Users.csv`)
   - Contains demographic and account information for each user.

2. **Movies Dataset** (`Movies.csv`)
   - Metadata and classification of movies available on the platform.

3. **Ratings Dataset** (`Ratings.csv`)
   - Logs of movie ratings by users, serving as implicit feedback for user preferences.

## Project Scope

The project covers the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean missing or inconsistent data
   - Normalize data formats (dates, categories)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize user activity, ratings distribution, and genre popularity
   - Analyze subscription trends and churn patterns

3. **User Segmentation**
   - Group users based on viewing behavior, rating patterns, and demographics
   - Identify high-potential free users for targeting

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL 
- Power BI

## Deliverables

- Cleaned and structured datasets
- Jupyter notebook with EDA 
- Dashboard for non-technical stakeholders
